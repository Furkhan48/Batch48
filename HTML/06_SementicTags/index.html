    <!-- Semantic tags are those tags that tell about itself to the 'browser' as well as 'Developer' -->
    <!-- example - table, form, img, header, footer, section, article, aside, nev, etc -->

    <!-- Non-semantic tags - by looking at the tags you wont be able to understand whats its purpose -->
    <!-- Example - div, span, a, h1, h2 -->

    <!-- We should always try to use Semantic tags. -->
    <!-- Because Semantic tags are good for SEO, readability, etx -->
